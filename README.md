# Py-FileMerge
Cross-platform command line tool for copying between, merging, and/or maintaining files across multiple directories.

Originally created to propagate file additions/deletions through multiple copies of a music library, because it was faster to code this than wait for WinMerge to do the same task.

v0.1 - This hasn't been extensively tested and there's barely any error checking, I've only checked it works for my use case.
